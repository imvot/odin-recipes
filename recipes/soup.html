		<h2>Creamy Tomato Soup</h2>
		<p>
		This creamy tomato soup is delicious and has a twist - the addition of strong, black coffee. This is the perfect summer dish for using freshly picked tomatoes from the garden. Remember - the better the quality of the tomatoes, the better the taste of the soup.

		<ul>
			<li>3 tablespoons butter</li>
			<li>1 cup chopped onion</li>
			<li>1/2 cup chopped carrots</li>
			<li>2 stalks celery, chopped</li>
			<li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
			<li>1/4 cup chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley</li>
			<li>2â€‰1/2 cups chopped fresh tomatoes</li>
			<li>1 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce</li>
			<li>3/4 cup strong brewed coffee</li>
			<li>1/4 cup water</li>
			<li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
			<li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
			<li>ground black pepper to taste</li>
			<li>1/3 cup heavy cream</li>
		</ul>
		
		<ol>
			<li>Melt the butter in a stock pot over medium heat.</li>
			<li>Stir in the onion, carrots, celery, garlic, and parsley; cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes.</li>

			<li>Bring the soup to a boil and simmer for 20 to 25 minutes.</li>
			<li>Pour the hot soup into a blender, filling the pitcher no more than halfway full. Hold down the lid of the blender with a folded kitchen towel, and carefully start the blender, using a few quick pulses to get the soup moving before leaving it on to puree.</li>
			<li>Puree in batches until smooth and pour into a clean pot.</li>
			<li>Stir in the cream and heat until warm. Do not boil.</li>
		</ol>
