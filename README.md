Just finished my first project from Odin!\
This one was pretty easy because I've already done some web development in the past.\
However I've learned how to do(or at least tried) how to do proper git commits.\

Edit:\
Adding some css and making it look not so terrible(I hope) was more challenging than I thought\
The exercises really helped because now I know how to master the cascade(but still don't know how to swim)... silence, no laughs\
